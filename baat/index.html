            <h4>조명에 대하여</h4>
            <p>
              조명에 관한 관심은 예전부터 있어 왔습니다. 저의 수많은 관심사의
              대부분은 아주 예전부터 있어 온 경우가 많습니다. 조명이 본격적으로
              제 관심의 울타리 속으로 들어온 것은 재작년 겨울, 전시 일정으로
              방문했던 대만의 타이난에서 시작되었습니다. 옛 대만의 수도이자
              대만에서 가장 오래된 도시인 타이난에는 예전 모습 그대로 남아있는
              옛 건물들이 많이 있었는데 그런 오래된 건물 내부의 조명들도 그대로
              남아 시대를 초월한 아름다움과 선을 넘지 않는 자연스러운 모습에
              놀랐습니다. <br />타이난의 어느 한 빈티지 상점에서 오래된 천장등을
              발견하고 구입해 집에 돌아와 거실의 천장에 설치하였습니다. 저런
              조명을 만들고 싶다. 그렇게 조명에 대한 생각이 시작되었고 그
              다음해의 봄, 연남동으로 쇼룸을 이전 오픈하면서 자연스럽게 조명을
              만들어서 설치하게 된 것이 오자 조명의 시작입니다.
            </p>

            <h4>유리에 대하여</h4>
            <p>
              유리 역시 아주 오래전부터 관심 이상의 호감으로 마음 깊이 품고 있던
              소재입니다. 도자기로 완전 전업을 결정했을 당시에 만약 유리를 배울
              수 있는 기회가 있었다면 저의 운명은 크게 달라졌을 것이라고
              생각됩니다. 몇 해 전 어느 날 우연히 캐스팅 유리 기법을 알게 되었고
              여러 날들의 시행착오를 거처 저만의 레시피를 얻게 되었습니다. 제가
              진심으로 좋아하는 작업은 대부분 주 업무에 밀려 연구가 중단되어
              왔는데 그중에 대표적인 작업이 유리 작업이었습니다. 이번 전시에
              소량의 유리 오브제를 내놓음으로써 앞으로 제가 아주! 좋아하는 유리
              작업이 끊기지 않고 오래 계속되길 바랍니다. 전시를 준비하며 아주
              오랜만에 ‘떨리는 마음으로 가마문을 여는’ 아주 귀한 경험을 하게
              되었습니다.

              <br />
              * 이번 유리 작업은 첫 번째로 선보이는 유리 작업인 점, 디자인하지
              않는 디자인의 일환으로서 그리고 유리 작업의 공장화를 원치 않는
              마음으로 테이블 웨어가 아닌 단순한 셰입의 오브제로 만들어
              보았습니다.
            </p>

            <h4>새로운 검은 빛 도자기에 대하여</h4>
            <p>
              작년 어느 때인가부터 연구하고 있는 디자인하지 않은 디자인에서
              시작된 생각의 한 지점입니다. 오자크래프트의 그레이쉬 테이블웨어를
              디자인하며 나타난 일종의 부작용 같은 본능적인 반응이 아닌가
              생각하고 있습니다. 언젠가부터 계획된 형태로부터 벗어나고자 하는
              움직임이 저의 내부로부터 일어나고 있었고 그 느낌을 조금씩 발전,
              구현시켜가고 있습니다. 디자인을 부정하는 것이 아닙니다. 이것은
              삶에 대한 하나의 커다란 방향성이며 언젠가 전체로 보여질 길
              가운데에 있습니다.

              <br />
              * 계획과 손의 흔적이 최소가 되도록 원형을 조각하였습니다. 기물의
              끝 부분이 점점 얇아져 사라지는 느낌을 의도로 조각하였으며 캐스팅
              과정, 건조과정에서 자연스럽게 생기는 갈라짐과 부서짐을 수습하지
              않았습니다. 흙을 먹에 담근 듯한 담백한 검은 빛을 표현하고
              싶었습니다.

              When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was
              acquainted with a young American couple who had among their
              belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive
              but not practicably companionable with me, because he knew no
              English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on
              his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and
              would learn no other. The family removed to America a month after
              I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose
              his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he
              hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed
              from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when
              he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns
              of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her
              son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A
              passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had
              gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
              young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the
              berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the
              companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim
              water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he
              turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
              seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with
              fright.
            </p>
            <p>
              His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number
              of dim corpses making for him and wagging their heads and swaying
              their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses
              forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He
              was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill. During some days he
              had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and
              while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and
              Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that
              tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books
              tell us that cases like this are not uncommon. Then the doctors
              ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them. Many
              languages and things get mislaid in a person’s head, and stay
              mislaid for lack of this remedy.

              Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were
              sent ashore; but nobody could go ashore and return. There were
              people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we
              could not receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term
              in Sydney. They could have escaped the day before, by ship to San
              Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they might have
              to wait weeks before any ship could venture to give them a passage
              any whither. And there were hardships for others. An elderly lady
              and her son, recreation-seekers from Massachusetts, had wandered
              westward, further and further from home, always intending to take
              the return track, but always concluding to go still a little
              further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu
              positively their last westward-bound indulgence—they had made up
              their minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in
              this world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two
              would have to stay with us as far as Australia. Then they could go
              on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the
              distance and the accommodations and outlay of time would be just
              the same, whichever of the two routes they might elect to take.
              Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually
              enlarged, without any elaborate degree of intention, to a possible
              twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to extensions by
              this time, and did not mind this new one much.

              When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was
              acquainted with a young American couple who had among their
              belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven—attractive
              but not practicably companionable with me, because he knew no
              English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on
              his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and
              would learn no other. The family removed to America a month after
              I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose
              his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he
              hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed
              from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when
              he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns
              of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her
              son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A
              passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had
              gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
              young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the
              berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the
              companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim
              water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he
              turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
              seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with
              fright.

            <p>
              His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number
              of dim corpses making for him and wagging their heads and swaying
              their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses
              forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He
              was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill. During some days he
              had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and
              while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and
              Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that
              tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books
              tell us that cases like this are not uncommon. Then the doctors
              ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them. Many
              languages and things get mislaid in a person’s head, and stay
              mislaid for lack of this remedy.

              Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were
              sent ashore; but nobody could go ashore and return. There were
              people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we
              could not receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term
              in Sydney. They could have escaped the day before, by ship to San
              Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they might have
              to wait weeks before any ship could venture to give them a passage
              any whither. And there were hardships for others. An elderly lady
              and her son, recreation-seekers from Massachusetts, had wandered
              westward, further and further from home, always intending to take
              the return track, but always concluding to go still a little
              further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu
              positively their last westward-bound indulgence—they had made up
              their minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in
              this world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two
              would have to stay with us as far as Australia. Then they could go
              on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the
              distance and the accommodations and outlay of time would be just
              the same, whichever of the two routes they might elect to take.
              Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually
              enlarged, without any elaborate degree of intention, to a possible
              twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to extensions by
              this time, and did not mind this new one much.

              English. He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on
              his father’s plantation, and had preferred their language and
              would learn no other. The family removed to America a month after
              I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy began to lose
              his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve he
              hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed
              from his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when
              he was twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns
              of New York, and the mother told me about an adventure which her
              son had been having. By trade he was now a professional diver. A
              passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake, and had
              gone down, carrying her people with her. A few days later the
              young diver descended, with his armor on, and entered the
              berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the
              companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim
              water. Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he
              turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and
              seemingly inspecting him inquiringly. He was paralyzed with
              fright.

              His entry had disturbed the water, and now he discerned a number
              of dim corpses making for him and wagging their heads and swaying
              their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance. His senses
              forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to the surface. He
              was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill. During some days he
              had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and
              while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and
              Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that
              tongue; but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books
              tell us that cases like this are not uncommon. Then the doctors
              ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them. Many
              languages and things get mislaid in a person’s head, and stay
              mislaid for lack of this remedy.

              Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were
              sent ashore; but nobody could go ashore and return. There were
              people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we
              could not receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term
              in Sydney. They could have escaped the day before, by ship to San
              Francisco; but the bars had been put up, now, and they might have
              to wait weeks before any ship could venture to give them a passage
              any whither. And there were hardships for others. An elderly lady
              and her son, recreation-seekers from Massachusetts, had wandered
              westward, further and further from home, always intending to take
              the return track, but always concluding to go still a little
              further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu
              positively their last westward-bound indulgence—they had made up
              their minds to that—but where is the use in making up your mind in
              this world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two
              would have to stay with us as far as Australia. Then they could go
              on around the world, or go back the way they had come; the
              distance and the accommodations and outlay of time would be just
              the same, whichever of the two routes they might elect to take.
              Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually
              enlarged, without any elaborate degree of intention, to a possible
              twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to extensions by
              this time, and did not mind this new one much.
