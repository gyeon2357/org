                Just like any diamond unearthed after many years, J Dilla's
                long-lost solo album The Diary is flawed, but still precious.

                By now, it's difficult to talk about James Dewitt Yancey—the
                accomplished producer and aspiring rapper known as Jay Dee, and
                more commonly J Dilla, or just Dilla, who passed away in
                2006—without dipping into hagiography. His legacy means many
                different things to hip-hop fans; he brought Pharcyde (and much
                of hip-hop) into adulthood on Pharcyde's 1995 album
                *LabCabinCalifornia, *placing warm and sunny beats under the
                L.A. quartet's disillusioned musings on identity, purpose, and
                struggles against commerce.

                Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant
                album from the past, and any record not in our archives is
                eligible. Today, we revisit a piece of Detroit history that
                rippled through all of hip-hop.

                The opening two notes of Welcome 2 Detroit, a dramatic double
                hit of modulated bass guitar and dusted organ, represent the
                culmination of a vast musical history. Not only was this album J
                Dilla’s debut as a 27-year-old solo artist, but it was also the
                first time that name appeared on a record cover. After nearly a
                decade of DIY releases, high-profile remixes, and productions
                credited to Jay Dee, slowly a renown bordering on reverence was
                built for one James DeWitt Yancey.

              <p class="column__text line-effect">
                What Dilla ultimately delivered to the label was not even close
                to a beat tape, which was what he was ostensibly commissioned to
                create.
